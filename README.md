# Web 2 Personal Website

## Tanner Morlan

*Since this was originally created, I have learned a lot more in classes and would improve upon many things in this website. I liked this design a lot though so I won't change much!*

## Website I created in my Web 2 class in 2020!

### All graphics were created by me in Photoshop!

### It also has responsive functionality to work on any device!
